Vertana[^1] is an LLM-powered agentic translation library for
TypeScript/JavaScript.  It goes beyond simple LLM prompting by using autonomous
agent workflows to gather rich contextual information, ensuring high-quality
translations that preserve meaning, tone, and formatting.

[^1]: The name *Vertana* is derived from the Sanskrit word *वर्तन* (*vartana*),
      meaning *turning*, *moving*, or *abiding*.

Features
--------

 -  *Agentic context gathering*: Automatically invoke external sources before
    translation, or let the LLM query passive sources as needed via tools
 -  *Smart chunking*: Content-aware chunkers for plain text, Markdown, and HTML
    that respect structural boundaries while staying within token limits
 -  *Glossary support*: Static glossaries for consistent terminology, plus
    dynamic glossary accumulation across chunks
 -  *Quality evaluation*: Assess translations on accuracy, fluency, terminology,
    and style dimensions
 -  *Iterative refinement*: Re-translate low-scoring chunks with boundary
    evaluation until quality thresholds are met
 -  *Best-of-N selection*: Generate translations with multiple models and
    select the best result via parallel per-chunk evaluation
 -  *Progress reporting*: Track translation stages via callbacks
 -  *Multi-runtime support*: Works seamlessly with Deno, Node.js, and Bun


Quick example
-------------

~~~~ typescript
import { translate } from "@vertana/facade";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const result = await translate(
  openai("gpt-4o"),
  "ko",
  "Hello, world!  Welcome to Vertana.",
);

console.log(result.text);
